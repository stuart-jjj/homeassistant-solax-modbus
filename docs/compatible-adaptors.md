### Waveshare USB to RS485 FT232RL

This USB adaptor is one of the best and most reliable USB adaptors.

Note that there are two versions with two different chipsets available. Make sure that you get the one with the FT232 RL chipset. Do not buy the adaptor with the CH343G chipset, which looks exactly the same.

## RS485 - Ethernet

Whatever adapter you buy, make sure it supports Modbus transmission. Transparent adapters that do not look into the Modbus protocol cannot send the packages to the correct Modbus slave.

### [SolaX PocketWiFi 3.0](https://www.solaxpower.com/monitoring-dongles/)

- Pocket WiFi 3.0 with Firmware V3.004.03 and above is only officially supported.
- SolaX only mentions Gen4 Hybrid, other inverters may work?

## Wifi - RS485

### [Tasmota modbus bridge on ESP8266](https://tasmota.github.io/docs/Modbus-Bridge)

An ESP8266 dongle with Tasmota installed and setup as a modbus bridge works great. 
Use a RS485 module to convert the modbus serial interface to RS485.
This works flawless for my Solis hybrid inverter.

## Untested but should work according to the specs...

### [USR-N510 RS485 to Ethernet](https://www.pusr.com/products/1-rs485-serial-port-etherne-device-servers-usr-n510.html)

Newer version of the USR-N510 without DB9 connector supporting RS485 (Specs mention RS232/RS485/RS422 Optional)

Should perform the same as the older version, although untested!

### [USR-TCP232-410S RS232 / RS485 Serial to Ethernet Adapter](https://www.pusr.com/products/modbus-serial-to-ethernet-converters-usr-tcp232-410s.html)

## Might work but potentially more hassle...

### [USR-TCP232-304 only supports a Virtual Com Port?](https://www.pusr.com/products/1-port-rs485-to-ethernet-converters-usr-tcp232-304.html)

![Image of USR-TCP232-304](images/adaptor-rs485-eth-usr-304.png)

As this Model appears to only gives you a Virtual Com Port it might prove difficult to pass into Home Assistant running in a VM or Home Assistant OS?

- You can use Modbus RTU over TCP

## Non Working / Troublesome RS485 Adaptors

### [SolaX PocketLAN](https://www.solaxpower.com/monitoring-dongles/)

This adaptor does not provide a Modbus connection

### [SolaX PocketWiFI 2](https://www.solaxpower.com/monitoring-dongles/)

- This adaptor provides a very unreliable Modbus connection, if any connectivity at all.
- No support for this adaptor will be provided.

### [Waveshare RS485 to WIFI/ETH](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/RS485_TO_WIFI/ETH)

This RS485 adaptor is very problematic:
- There seems to be delayed communications,
- Struggles to read more than 7 registers at a time,
- Modbus Error: [Input/Output] Unable to decode request,
- No ability to set "Auto query storage type" for Sofar Inverters.

### [Waveshare RS485 to ETH](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/RS485_TO_ETH)
**Not to be confused with the DIN Rail mounted Waveshare RS485 TO ETH (B) mentioned above.**
- This adaptor does not support "Modbus Transmission" it is a passive device.
- You can't submit requests to the Inverter.
- It does not work!
